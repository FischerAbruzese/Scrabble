## To test out the broken website: https://scrabble-j2qi.onrender.com/

fair warning you'll probably crash the server. 
Also its one game instance for everyone that accesses it so you gotta be the first one since the last time it crashed since its set up to run with one player 
(it'll crash before the second player could make a move anyway)

## To run the text based version, switch to branch: game-dev
it might have some minor bugs but the text gui isn't in master while we develop the website
